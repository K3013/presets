<p className="lead">A BetterRTX preset inspired by my Deferred shaderpack : Klash Graphics Deferred !</p>

That new BetterRTX includes:

- Shape-perfect shadows
- Revised caustics
- Inspired by Klash Graphics Deferred

For test the original pack : enable Vibrant Visuals and download the shaderpack to this link : [https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft-bedrock/texture-packs/klash-deferred](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft-bedrock/texture-packs/klash-deferred)
